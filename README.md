# Module3Challenge
This is the challenge for Module 3
I had problems with the "with open("...." because I couldn't figure out why by just putting "Resources/budget_data.csv" wouldn't work, until I saw that it said there was no such file in my user folder. Then I realized I have to put in the whole file path.
