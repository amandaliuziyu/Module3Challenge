# Module3Challenge
This is the challenge for Module 3

I got more than half of the points deducted because I had a fixed file path which only works on my computer and not others. Thus, I fixed it by directing the path to where the "main.py" files were and then join path with the csvfiles containing the data. I also fixed that same issue regarding outputing the text files.
